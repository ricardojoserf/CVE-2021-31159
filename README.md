# Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus MSP - Active Directory User Enumeration

This script takes advantage of ServiceDesk Plus before 10519 having different output in the password recovery functionality: if the user exists it returns a message claiming an email has been sent but if it does not exist the message is constant. 

Knowing this it is possible to enumerate accounts in the application or, what we will try to exploit with this script, accounts of an Active Directory if AD authentication is enabled. Very useful when the application is open to the internet and the format of the AD user accounts is known.

```
python3 exploit.py -t TARGET_URL -d DOMAIN -U USERSFILE [-O OUTPUTFILE]
```
