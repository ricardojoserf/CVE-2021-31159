# Zoho Service Desk Plus - Active Directory (AD) User Enumeration

This script takes advantage of Service Desk Plus having different output in the password recovery functionality, if the user does not exist the return it states such user does not exist. Knowing this, it is possible to enumerate accounts in an Active Directory if AD authentication is enabled. 

```
python3 list_users.py -t TARGET_URL -d DOMAIN -U USERSFILE [-O OUTPUTFILE]
```
